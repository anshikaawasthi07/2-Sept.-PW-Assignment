<!-- Ques2:- Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in an HTML
document.
Solution:
The comment tag is used to insert comments in the source code. Comments are not displayed in the browsers. You can use comments to explain your code, which can help you when you edit the source code at a later date. This is especially useful if you have a lot of code. -->

Example:-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Example of how to use comments in an HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
 <!-- This is a comment explaining about the purpose of the heading the heading is showing that welcome to my website -->
<h1>Welcome to my website</h1> 
<!-- <P>this paragraph is commented out</P>  -->
<!-- Note:The above paragraph line is commented out and will not displayed -->
<!-- TODO:YOU can add such more Comments By adding Many more things later -->
</body>
</html>
<!-- [ The first comment provides an explanation about the purpose of the heading>
[ The second comment is used to disayled the paragraph temporarily. 
[ The third comment includes the "TODO" la?el, indicating that there's a task to be done later, such as adding
more content to the web page. -->
